                        The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to unite teams in creating fast,
                        accessible and mobile friendly digital services with a common set of UI components that comply
                        to Digital Service Standards

                    <p>What are some necessary technology standards that guide how government websites and digital
                        services deliver what end users require?</p>
                    <p>In the past, that question is often left unanswered after a digital service is rolled out. As the
                        years go by, user expectations might have changed. The key to higher standards is to constantly
                        and consistently deliver a top-notch digital experience for users.</p>
                    <p>As the Singapore Government rolls out more digital services and develops websites in the future,
                        what we need is a consistent effort to test and measure in order to provide a complete user
                        experience for users.</p>

                    <p>There are government services provided for different type of websites:</p>

                    <p>A static information site is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It
                        requires no server-side processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScript. In simpler terms, it requires no use of the back-end.</p>
                    <p>Isomer is an informational website generator created by the Government Technology Agency of
                        Singapore (GovTech). It provides template for website with hosting and is compliant to
                        applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and
                        Usability Checklist (UC).</p>

                    <p>Dynamic information websites use languages like PHP to interact with information stored in
                        databases. For this reason, dynamic sites are much more complicated and expensive to create. Not
                        only is web hosting required, but databases or servers must be created as well. The languages
                        used to create dynamic sites are also much more complicated than the client-side languages.</p>
                    <p>Content Website Platform (CWP) is a common secured environment based on a resilient, robust and
                        controlled platform which provides a suite of standardised software for hosting content-based
                        websites. It enables unclassified government websites to be centrally managed and operated on
                        public cloud.</p>

                    <p>A transactional website is a site that has the ability to process financial transactions. Typical
                        transactions include online banking, financial account management, bill payment, retail
                        purchases, wire transfers, employee payroll and loan application processing.</p>
                    <p>Such websites are typically built and maintained by appointed vendors. Hence, the vendors can
                        make use of our Design System for their frontend development.</p>

                    <p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be
                        assembled together to build any number of applications. It enable teams to build better products faster by making
                        design reusable, where reusability makes scale possible.</p>
                    <p>This concept can be explained better with the <a

                        defined by Brad Frost. It is a methodology for creating design systems and there are five
                        distinct levels in it:</p>

                            <td>Pages are specific instances of templates. This is where most reviews revolve around
                            </td>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>Atomic design provide the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can
                        create systems that promotes consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their
                        final context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we are crafting a system right out of the
                        gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>
