    The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to unite teams in creating fast,
    accessible and mobile friendly digital services with a common set of UI components that comply
    to the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/">Digital Service
        Standards.</a>

<h4 class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Background</h4>
<p>What are some necessary technology standards that guide government websites and services in
    delivering the best results for end users?</p>
<p>
    Over the years, this question was left unanswered even as more and more websites and digital
    services were rolled out. As the web constantly evolves, so do user expectations. The Government
    must do the same if it wants to maintain the highest standards in digital service delivery.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Where to use SGDS</h4>
<h5 class="margin--bottom has-text-primary">Static Informational Websites</h5>
<p>A static site is the most basic website, and the easiest to build. It
    requires no server-side processing, serving only client-side content in the form of HTML pages
    (and optionally CSS and JavaScript) to users' browsers or mobile phones.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.isomer.gov.sg/">Isomer</a></strong> is an informational website
    generator created by the Government
    Technology Agency of
    Singapore (GovTech). It provides templates for websites based on SGDS, allows users to easily
    edit website content, provides hosting and is compliant to
    applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and
    Usability Checklist (UC).</p>

<h5 class="margin--bottom has-text-primary">Dynamic Informational Websites</h5>
<p>
    Similar to static sites, dynamic websites serve client-side content. However, it uses a server
    and database to generate such client-side content on the fly before serving them to user
    devices.</p>
<p>
    For example, WordPress sites commonly make use of PHP programs together
    with MySQL as a database to serve dynamically-generated content to users. They also support user
    logins for content writers. For this reason, dynamic websites tend to be more complicated and
    costly to build.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.xtremax.com/discover-cwp">Content Website Platform
            (CWP)</a></strong> is a common secured website building and serving platform. It
    provides a suite of standardised software for hosting content-based
    websites. It enables unclassified government websites to be centrally managed and operated in
    the public cloud.</p>

<h5 class="margin--bottom has-text-primary">Transactional Websites</h5>
<p>A transactional website is a full-scale website that allows users to perform transactions, for
    example online banking or retail purchases. Government transactional sites typically allow users
    to interact with government services digitally, such as HDB or CPF.</p>
<p>Transactional sites are usually built by vendors, who are encouraged to leverage on SGDS to
    deliver the best user experience.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Why use a design system?</h4>
<p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be
    assembled together to build any number of applications. It enable teams to build better products
    more quickly at scale by making design reusable.</p>
<p>This concept can be explained better with the concept of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"

    from Brad Frost:</p>

            <td>Atoms</td>

            <td>Organisms</td>
            <td>Groups of molecules joined together to form a complex section of an interface</td>

            <td>Templates</td>
            <td>Groups of organisms stitched together to form pages</td>

        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-page is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Pages</td>
            <td>Pages are specific instances of templates. These are what end users ultimately see
            </td>

<p>Atomic design comprises designs spanning from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can
    create products that are both visually consistent, yet have each retain distinct features.
    And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we are crafting a system right out
    of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>
