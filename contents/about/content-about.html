<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to unite teams in creating fast,
    accessible and mobile friendly digital services with a common set of UI components that comply
    to the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/">Digital Service
    Standards.</a> As the web constantly evolves, so do user expectations. The Government
    must do the same if it wants to maintain the highest standards in digital service delivery.</p>

<h3>Where to use SGDS</h3>

<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Static Informational Websites</h4>
    <p>A static site is the most basic website, and the easiest to build. It
        requires no server-side processing, serving only client-side content in the form of HTML pages
        (and optionally CSS and JavaScript) to users' browsers or mobile phones.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.isomer.gov.sg/">Isomer</a></strong> is an informational website
        generator created by the Government
        Technology Agency of
        Singapore (GovTech). It provides templates for websites based on SGDS, allows users to easily
        edit website content, provides hosting and is compliant to
        applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and
        Usability Checklist (UC).</p>

</div>
<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Dynamic Informational Websites</h4>
    <p>
        Similar to static sites, dynamic websites serve client-side content. However, it uses a server
        and database to generate such client-side content on the fly before serving them to user
        devices.</p>
    <p>
        For example, WordPress sites commonly make use of PHP programs together
        with MySQL as a database to serve dynamically-generated content to users. They also support user
        logins for content writers. For this reason, dynamic websites tend to be more complicated and
        costly to build.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.xtremax.com/discover-cwp">Content Website Platform
                (CWP)</a></strong> is a common secured website building and serving platform. It
        provides a suite of standardised software for hosting content-based
        websites. It enables unclassified government websites to be centrally managed and operated in
        the public cloud.</p>

<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Transactional Websites</h4>
    <p>A transactional website is a full-scale website that allows users to perform transactions, for
        example online banking or retail purchases. Government transactional sites typically allow users
        to interact with government services digitally, such as HDB or CPF.</p>
    <p>Transactional sites are usually built by vendors, who are encouraged to leverage on SGDS to
        deliver the best user experience.</p>

<h3>
    Our Core Principles
</h3>
<p>
    We constantly keep these core principles in mind when making design decisions
    at SGDS.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Clarity:</b> Easy to understand and navigate. Elements highlight
    important content and improve interactivity.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Efficiency:</b> Optimised workflows that help you to deliver the highest
    quality government websites to the public easily.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Consistency:</b> A consistent and unified government branding implements
    familiar standards and strengthens intuition by using standard text styles,
    icons and interface elements.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Reusable:</b> Eliminate the burden of recreating basic components and
    patterns for every new product. Components in Design System will be a
    comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect the
    industry best practices.

<h3>Why use a design system?</h3>
<p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be
    assembled together to build any number of applications. It enable teams to build better products
    more quickly at scale by making design reusable.</p>
<p>This concept can be explained better with the concept of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"
        target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>
    from Brad Frost:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-atom is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Atoms</td>
            <td>The basic building blocks, for e.g. form label, an icon or a button</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-molecule is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Molecules</td>
            <td>Groups of atoms bonded together to do one thing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-organism is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Organisms</td>
            <td>Groups of molecules joined together to form a complex section of an interface</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-template is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Templates</td>
            <td>Groups of organisms stitched together to form pages</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-page is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Pages</td>
            <td>Pages are specific instances of templates. These are what end users ultimately see
            </td>
        </tr>

<p>Atomic design comprises designs spanning from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can
    create products that are both visually consistent, yet have each retain distinct features.
    And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we are crafting a system right out
    of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>
