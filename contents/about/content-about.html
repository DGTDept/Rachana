                    <p>What are some necessary technology standards that guide how websites and digital services deliver what end
                        users require?</p>
                    <p>In the past, that question is often left unanswered after a digital service is rolled out. As the years go
                        by, user expectations might have changed. The key to higher standards is to constantly and consistently
                        deliver a top-notch digital experience for users.</p>
                    <p>As the Singapore Government rolls out more digital services and develops websites in the future, what we need
                        is a consistent effort to test and measure in order to provide a complete user experience for users.</p>

                    <p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled
                        together to build any number of applications. It enable teams to build better products faster by making
                        design reusable, where reusability makes scale possible.</p>
                    <p>This concept can be explained better with the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>, defined by Brad Frost. It is a methodology for creating design systems and there are five distinct levels in it:</p>

                    <p>Atomic design provide the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can create
                        systems that promotes consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their final
                        context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we are crafting a system right out of the gate
                        instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>
