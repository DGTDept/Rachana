        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">How does FormSG handle classified data?</h3>
        <p>FormSG can capture classified data, because it does not store them. FormSG forwards each form response directly to your Outlook mailbox. You then use the FormSG Data Collation Tool on the government Intranet to collate email form responses into an Excel spreadsheet. This tool does not collect your classified data; it simply does the collation on your web browser.</p>

    <div class="col">
        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">What classification of data can FormSG handle?</h3>
        <p>If your per-entry data is Restricted, but the whole collection of data is Confidential, FormSG has you covered. This is because FormSG is a Restricted system that can manage Restricted data flowing through it, but ultimately data is stored in SG-Mail, which is a Confidential system that lets you store Confidential collections of data.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">What is the cost of using FormSG?</h3>
        <p>FormSG is free to use. At this point, we have not come up with a model to charge agencies, and we will only re-evaluate this toward the end of FY 2018. Our main costs are SingPass and CorpPass, and we will likely pass down just these costs to agencies.</p>
