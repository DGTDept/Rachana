                    <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Benefits of Isomer Pages</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="margin--bottom"><b>Improved security over dynamic sites</b><br>Static sites are only made up of static files. Consequently, there is nothing dynamic that can be exploited in static sites. Dynamic sites on the other hand have one or more web application servers and databases that increase the surface area for exploitation</li>
                        <li class="margin--bottom"><b>Improved performance over dynamic sites</b><br>Static site pages are pre-generated, while dynamic site pages are generated on-the-fly. And because static sites are generated beforehand, they can be served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This greatly improves user experience because of faster website loading times</li>
                        <li class="margin--bottom"><b>Less downtime compared to dynamic sites</b><br>Static site pages can be pre-generated and hosted in multiple places, allowing for redundancy</li>
                    </ul>
