        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Government services should be “digital to the core”, by providing users with an end-to-end digital option.  Digital services should be accessible anytime and anywhere. By adopting a responsive design, digital services will be easy to browse and use, regardless of whether the user accesses it from a laptop, tablet or smartphone.  For instant recognition and contemporary look of government digital services, a new masthead will also be adopted.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Usability</h3>
        <p>Digital services must be easy to use without having the users to repeat information.  For instance, digital services should tap on existing platforms such as MyInfo, to help users save time by automatically filling up government digital forms.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Digital services must be usable to as many potential users as possible, including people with special needs.  We embrace the Web Content Accessibility Standards (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  This is a globally adopted standard to ensure web content accessibility to different users.  This includes meeting a minimum contrast ratio and having descriptive text alternatives to images and videos so that the digital services can be used with assistive technologies, such as speech readers.</p>
        <p>We also align with local industry standards such as SPRING’s Guidelines on User Interface Design for Older Adults (SS618) that aims to further enhance the online user experience of our websites.</p>
        <p>In addition, digital services should be delivered in common language (English, and any additional languages that better serve target users), and have useful, relevant and easy-to-understand content.  This includes writing the content concisely in simple language and highlighting the important content, so that users can easily understand.</p>
