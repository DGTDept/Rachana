        <p>The checklist consists of 27 points that are broadly categorised into 5 sections, namely: (i) Homepage, (ii) Accessibility, (iii) Navigation, (iv) Content, (v) Performance and User Experience. Each point has three ratings: Pass, Consider Fixing (Usability violation but not critical), and Should fix (High impact violations. Should be fixed immediately).</p>

            <li class="margin--bottom">an evaluation of aesthetics, though a minimalist approach is always preferred</li>
            <li class="margin--bottom">recommendations on business strategies, colour palette, typefaces or interface design trends</li>
            <li class="margin--bottom">a replacement for user testing. Usability testing is a very important assessment method that will uncover issues which might not fall within the scope of this checklist.</li>
