                <p>Blueprint is a Design System that contains a collection of reusable UI Components, guided by clear Digital Services Standards, that can be assembled together to bulid any number of applications.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Apart from having a big box of UI Lego pieces that can be assembled in many different ways, Blueprint provides structure and meaning in a set of guidelines. It is not a generic web page, but the embodiment of a system of concepts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With a guide on why and how to use them, our UI Components and Templates become easier to use and clearer to discern.</p>

                <p>We studied what most of our interfaces are comprised of and broke them down into fundamental building blocks and work up from there. From those individual UI elements, we can combine them into standard modules and templates to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.</p>
