<h4>When you should use this component</h4>
<p>
    Use this component when you need to ask user's for their email address and state clearly what
    their email address will be used for.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<h4>Tell users how their email address will be used</h4>
<p>Make it clear to the user what it will be used for. This is so that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>users will be confident that you will not abuse their email address</li>
    <li>users are able to choose which email address they want to use</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make sure it works for all users</h4>
<p>
    A email address can be 256 characters long including punctuation, so do make sure your text
    field can accomodate the maximum length for email addresses.
</p>

<h4>Help users along when entering their email addresses</h4>
<p>Make it easier for users to enter their email address by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>allowing them to copy and paste their email address</li>
    <li>
        setting the <code>type</code> attribute to <code>email</code> so that the correct keyboard
        is displayed
    </li>
    <li>
        setting the <code>spellcheck</code> attribute to <code>false</code> so that their email
        addresses are not spell checked by the browser or device
    </li>
    <li>
        setting the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute so that browsers can fill in their email
        address if they have entered it previously
    </li>
    <li>You will need to include the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute to meet
        <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html"
            target="_blank"
            >WCAG 2.1 AA</a
        >
        for production.</li>
</ul>
