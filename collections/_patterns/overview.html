<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Here you find common patterns that you can use to start building your site. These are baseline
    patterns and can be tweaked to suit your product or service, these have basic accessibility
    built in like <code>autocomplete</code> attribute for form fields where it is needed. Do refer
    back to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">WCAG</a> to
    see if you need to add in more to meet certain standards that you are trying to achieve.
