<h4 class="margin--top--lg has-text-weight-semibold">When you should use this pattern</h4>
<p>
    You should follow this pattern when you need to ask for a userâ€™s name and only ask for names if
    you need that information to deliver a service.
</p>

<h4 class="margin--top--lg has-text-weight-semibold">Guidelines</h4>
<h5>Make sure the name field works for your users</h5>
<p>
    Name fields should be long enough to accomodate the names of your users. Do make sure that you
    support all characters that users may need to enter, including symbols and numbers.
</p>

<h5>Single name fields</h5>
<p>
    This can accomodate the widest range of name types and formats and is recommended to reduce the
    risk that your user's enter their name in the incorrect format. However by using this, you may
    not be able to reliable extract parts of a name.
</p>

<h5>Multiple name fields</h5>
<p>
    Use multiple name fields based on your user's needs. Not everyone's name fits the general
    first-name, last-name convention. Using multiple name fields increases the risk that a person's
    name will not fit the same convention and may be entered incorrectly.
</p>

<h5>Labelling of name fields</h5>
<p>
    For single name fields, use "Full name".
</p>

<p>
    For multiple name fields, use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>'Given name'</li>
    <li>'Family name'</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Do make it clear whether you are asking for a user's common name, or as written on a official
    document such as NRIC or passport.
</p>

<p>
    If you are unsure of how your users will fill in their name or know that you have a wide range
    of users with different formats for their names, it is highly recommended to use a single name
    field.
</p>

<p>
    This is to ensure that your users:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do not get confused as to how they should be filling in their name</li>
    <li>
        Reduce the risk that their name may be filled in wrongly and making extracting their names
        difficult
    </li>
</ul>
