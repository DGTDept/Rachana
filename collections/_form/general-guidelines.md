## General form design guidelines

### Make the path to completion clear

- Avoid multiple columns
- Left align labels and fields
- Use wizards to break long forms
- If possible, allow users to save progress
- Indicate completion progress
- Make primary and secondary call-to-action buttons distinct and obvious
- Call-to-action labels should be short and clear

### Make the form easy to understand

- Choose field types appropriately - this reduces confusion and makes data collected easier to process
- Group related fields
- Label fields as optional instead of compulsory
  - Avoid using asterisks to mark compulsory fields
- Do not use placeholders to replace labels
- Use autocomplete

### Give feedback on interactions

- Field validation should be inline (display errors next to the field)
- Use a non-combative tone in error messages
- Validate input in real time
