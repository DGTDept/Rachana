<h5>
  Implementing Content Design
</h5>
<p>
  Most accessibility principles can be implemented very easily and will not
  impact the overall "look and feel" of a web site.
</p>
<div class="sgds-accordion-container">
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide informative, unique page titles
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        For each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content
        and distinguishes it from other pages. The page title is often the same
        as the main heading of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the
        name of the page before the name of the organization. For pages that are
        part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the page
        title.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Use headings to convey meaning & structure
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Use short headings to group related paragraphs and clearly describe the
        sections. Good headings provide an outline of the content.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Make link text meaningful
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Write link text so that it describes the content of the link target.
        Avoid using ambiguous link text, such as 'click here' or 'read more'.
        Indicate relevant information about the link target, such as document
        type and size, for example, 'Proposal Documents (RTF, 20MB)'.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Write meaningful text alternatives for images
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        For every image, write alternative text that provides the information or
        function of the image. For purely decorative images, there is no need to
        write alternative text.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Create transcripts & captions for multimedia
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        For audio-only content, such a podcast, provide a transcript. For audio
        and visual content, such as training videos, also provide captions.
        Include in the transcripts and captions the spoken information and
        sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example,
        'door creaks'. For video transcripts, also include a description of the
        important visual content, for example 'Athan leaves the room'.

    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission,
        alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of
        changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify. Important
        feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent
        style.

    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Ensure that instructions, guidance, and error messages are clear, easy
        to understand, and avoid unnecessarily technical language. Describe
        input requirements, such as date formats. Instructions communicate what
        information the user should provide. Error indicates what the problem is
        and, possibly, how to fix it.

          Avoid using unnecessarily complex words and phrases. Consider
          providing a glossary for terms readers may not know

          Expand acronyms on first use. For example, Web Content Accessibility

        <li>Use list formatting as appropriate</li>

          Consider using images, illustrations, video, audio, and symbols to
          help clarify meaning
