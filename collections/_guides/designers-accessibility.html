<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Implementing UI Design</h5>
<p>
  Most accessibility principles can be implemented very easily and will not
  impact the overall "look and feel" of a web site.

<div class="sgds-accordion-container">
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      <h6>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background</h6>
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background
        colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and
        other elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that
        happens to be in a photograph. Minimum contrast ratio (level AA) should
        be 4.5:1 and enhanced contrast ratio (level AAA) should be at least 7:1.

      <h6>Do not use color alone to convey information</h6>
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the
        only way information is conveyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional
        identification that does not rely on color perception. For example, use
        an asterisk in addition to color to indicate required form fields, and
        use labels to distinguish areas on graphs.
      </p>

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and
        buttons, to make them easy to identify. For example, change the
        appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and touch-screen
        activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are
        used consistently throughout the website.
      </p>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      <h6>Provide clear and consistent navigation options</h6>

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent
        naming, styling, and positioning. Provide more than one method of
        website navigation, such as a site search or a site map. Help users
        understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation
        cues, such as breadcrumbs and clear headings.

      <h6>Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels</h6>
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field.
        For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left
        or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they
        are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and
        fields.

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission,
        alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of
        changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify. Important
        feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent
        style.

      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more
        apparent. Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it
        easier to scan and understand.
      </p>

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports,
        such as mobile phones or zoomed browser windows. Position and
        presentation of main elements, such as header and navigation can be
        changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line
        width are set to maximize readability and legibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Display in a wide window with small text uses multiple columns for
        primary content, visible navigation options, and visible secondary
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or with large text
        uses single column for primary content, navigation options are revealed
        using an icon, and secondary information is also revealed via icon.

      <h6>Include image and media alternatives in your design</h6>

    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide a place in your design for alternatives for images and media.
        For example, you might need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visible links to transcripts of audio</li>
        <li>Visible links to audio described versions of videos</li>
        <li>Text along with icons and graphical buttons</li>

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or
        auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background
        sound, and videos.
