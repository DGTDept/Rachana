<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The callout is an excerpt of text used in design to draw attention to or label content.</p>

<hr/>
<div class="sgds-example-others">
    {{default_callout}}
</div>
{%- highlight html -%}{{default_callout}}{%- endhighlight -%}
<button class="sgds-button clipboard-btn is-primary is-outlined" data-clipboard-target='.highlight0'>Copy snippet</button>

<h4>When you should use this component</h4>
<p>
    You should use the callout component when you want to highlight very specific 
    information within a page and to differentiate it from
    content that surrounds it. E.g quotes or additional information.
</p>

<p>
    The callout component should be used sparingly and
    there should not be multiple callouts on your page as they
    may lose their effectiveness, or worse confuse users.
</p>

<h4>When you should consider something else</h4>
<p>
    Callouts should not be used in complex pages as some users may 
    not notice the callout if they are presented together
    with other visually prominent elements.
</p>

<p>
    If there is a need to draw attention to important or critical information, 
    you may want to consider using the
    <a href="/docs/notification">notification</a> component with the correct color state instead.
</p>
