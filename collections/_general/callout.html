<h4 class="margin--top--lg has-text-weight-semibold">When you should use this component</h4>
<p>You should use the callout component when you want to highlight very specific information within a page and to differentiate it from
    content that surrounds it. E.g Quotes or additional information.
</p>

<p>The callout component should be used sparingly and not have multiple callouts on your page as this will lose it's effectiveness and may confuse users.
    </p>

<h4 class="margin--top--lg has-text-weight-semibold">When you should consider something else</h4>
<p>Callouts should not be used in complex pages as some users may not notice the callout if they are presented together
    with visually prominent elements.</p>

<p>If there is a need to draw attention to important or critical information, you may want to consider using the
    <a href="/docs/notification">notification</a> component with the correct color state instead.</p>

<hr/>

<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold">Guidelines</h5>
<p>Callout should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use when you want to highlight certain part of an article prominently</li>
    <li>Use sparingly in a page as too many of it will cause distractions</li>
</ul>
