    <p>Along with the development of Industrial Revolution, 4.0 in doing digital transformation in Cambodia.
      The Digital Government Committee has created Rachana, to assist with
      the digital transformation process with the goal to strengthen government agencies to create digital
      services that are quick, responsive, and easy to use.
      Additionally, the Rachana system also contains sample
      components, design patterns, and templates.
    </p>
    <p>The Rachana system has a strong emphasis on modularity, and a unified code base to assist in
      development, eliminate inconsistency, and improve efficiency.

    <h2 id="how-do-you-use-cgds">How Do You Use Rachana?</h2>
    There are three main use cases for Rachana:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Static Informational Websites</strong> are basic and easy to build. They only provide
          client-side
          content in the form of HTML pages (alternatively, CSS or JavaScript), and do not require
          server-side
          processing. To launch such websites, agencies can make use of the Rachana CSS/JavaScript with
          template
          package and incorporate it into any open-source static site generator like <a
            href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Alternatively, agencies can also use
          the
          Rachana package as a base to start building their websites.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Informational Websites</strong> also provide client-side content. However, unlike
          Static Informational Websites, Dynamic Informational Websites generate such content using a server and
          database. To launch such websites, agencies can use the Rachana WordPress or Sitefinity package to
          develop locally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Transactional Websites are</strong> the most complex among the three. They support
          transactions
          such as online banking and retail purchasing. Agencies are able to use Rachana to start building or
          choose
          which components they require for their websites.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
